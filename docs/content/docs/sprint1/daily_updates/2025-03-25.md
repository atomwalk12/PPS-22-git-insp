## Overview

The first day was dedicated to establishing a robust development infrastructure, focusing on continuous integration and documentation pipelines.

## Completed Tasks

### CI/CD Setup
- Implemented Scala test workflow with coverage reporting
- Integrated Codecov for tracking code coverage metrics
- Added Codecov badge to README for visibility
- Updated GitHub Actions to use Ubuntu 22.04 for improved performance

### Documentation Infrastructure
- Restructured documentation system
- Set up Hugo-based documentation site
- Configured ScalaDoc and Scoverage report integration
- Established proper file organization for development process documentation
- Created initial sprint documentation structure

### Workflow Improvements
- Enhanced concurrency settings in GitHub Actions to prevent deployment conflicts
- Streamlined documentation deployment process
- Renamed workflows for better clarity (e.g., "Docs CI")

## Technical Details
- Updated ScalaDoc and Scoverage report paths to align with new documentation structure
- Configured secure access for Codecov integration using tokens
- Optimized GitHub Pages deployment workflow

## Next Steps
- Begin implementation of core functionality
- Continue expanding test coverage
- Further enhance documentation with project details
