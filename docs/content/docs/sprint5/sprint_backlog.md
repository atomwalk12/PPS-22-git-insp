**Sprint Goal:** The purpose of the sprint is to complete the project report and analysis. Project housekeeping is also included with tasks such as refactoring, cleanup and release. 

The sprint took two weeks instead of one. It was responsible of one larger task, and since I prefered each sprint to have a single, well-defined focus, I decided not to split it into two sprints.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Complete project report and documentation
2. Project housekeeping tasks such as refactoring, cleanup and release
3. Since the project is almost complete and the code is stable, the ArchUnit tests are finalized.
4. The visualization analysis is finalized.
