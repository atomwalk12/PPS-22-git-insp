## Completed Tasks

### Ingestion Pipeline Development
- Implemented IngestorService for document processing from Git repositories
- Created IngestionStrategy trait with document transformation and splitting capabilities
- Developed DefaultIngestionStrategy with language-specific processing logic
- Integrated IngestionStrategyFactory for dynamic strategy instantiation

### Text Processing Implementation
- Introduced TextSplitter base class for document segmentation
- Added RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for advanced code snippet parsing
- Implemented language-based splitting configurations

### Configuration and Utility Enhancement
- Updated application.conf with Qdrant embedding dimensions
- Added code and text embedding configuration parameters
- Created URLSanitizerService for URL handling in GitRepository
- Added CSS styles for content display area layout

### Build and Testing Improvements
- Added Wart.Equals to wartremoverWarnings for stricter equality checking
- Included ArchUnit dependency for architectural testing
- Implemented comprehensive test suite for the ingestor module
- Updated CacheServiceSuite, IngestorServiceSuite, and PipelineSuite

## Technical Details
- Pipeline now coordinates with IngestorService for generating indices from repositories
- CacheService enhanced to provide ingestor retrieval based on index and strategy
- Text splitter implementation draws inspiration from langchain Python source code
- Embedding configurations include size, chunk size, and chunk overlap parameters

## Next Steps
- Implement front-end components for user interaction
- Develop query processing pipeline
- Add a process to retrieve current indexes present in the database
