## Completed Tasks

### Streaming Analysis Implementation
- Updated `AnalysisStrategy` trait to support asynchronous analysis with streaming responses
- Implemented `CodeAnalysisStrategy` and `NaturalLanguageStrategy` with streaming functionality
- Introduced `StreamingAssistant` utility for managing chat interactions
- Modified `AnalysisContext` to accommodate new analysis method signatures

### Testing Infrastructure Enhancement
- Added Mockito support for dependency mocking in tests
- Enhanced `AnalysisTest` with chat model interaction tests
- Set up mock configurations for testing streaming capabilities
- Verified interactions with mocked components

### Language and Embedding Support
- Created a `Language` enum to represent supported programming languages
- Enhanced RAG component factory with embedding model creation based on language
- Updated testing suite to validate embedding model functionality
- Temporarily added mockito-inline dependency (later removed)

### Query Routing System
- Implemented `QueryRoutingStrategy` trait with conditional and default implementations
- Developed `QueryRoutingStrategyFactory` for creating appropriate strategies
- Refined `ConditionalQueryStrategy` to improve query handling logic
- Enhanced `RAGComponentFactory` to include query router creation methods

### RAG Pipeline Components
- Renamed `DefaultRAGComponentFactory` to `RAGComponentFactoryImpl` for clarity
- Added reranker configuration and content aggregator to RAG pipeline
- Implemented retrieval augmentor creation combining router and content aggregator
- Simplified syntax and improved code readability throughout

## Challenges
- Balancing complexity between different routing strategies
- Ensuring proper interaction between streaming components and analysis strategies
- Coordinating multiple factory components while maintaining clean architecture

## Next Steps
- Integrate RAG components with repository analysis system
- Expand test coverage for complex RAG scenarios
