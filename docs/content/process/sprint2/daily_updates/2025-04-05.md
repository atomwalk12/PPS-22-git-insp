## Completed Tasks

### GitHub Integration
- Implemented GithubWrapperService for fetching and building Git repositories from URLs
- Integrated GithubWrapperService into the Pipeline for improved repository handling
- Created URLClient class for handling HTTP requests with robust error management
- Added utility methods for repository language detection and document processing

### Error Handling Improvements
- Enhanced logging and error handling in RAGComponentFactory and IngestorService
- Replaced try-catch blocks with Try and recover patterns for functional error handling
- Refactored createCollection method to return Try[Unit] for better error propagation
- Implemented improved logging for collection operations (creation, deletion, listing)

### Qdrant Collection Management
- Fixed Qdrant integration to create separate collections for each file type
- Added methods for deleting and listing collections in Qdrant
- Improved index name handling to support language-specific collections
- Updated the Pipeline interface to support index regeneration

### Testing Enhancements
- Added comprehensive tests for GithubWrapperService, covering repository fetching and error handling
- Updated Pipeline tests to include dependency injection for GithubWrapperService
- Introduced new test suite for external services with appropriate tagging
- Enhanced test configurations for clearer output and better error detection

## Technical Details
- Used Try monad extensively for error handling and propagation
- Implemented URL sanitization methods for safer repository identifier generation
- Applied functional programming patterns for error recovery and transformation
- Released version 1.3.1 with fixes for Qdrant collection management

## Infrastructure Updates
- Added Docker Compose configuration for Qdrant service with appropriate volume mappings
- Updated application.conf to include chat memory settings for message history management
- Added 'qdrant_data' to .gitignore for better repository cleanliness
