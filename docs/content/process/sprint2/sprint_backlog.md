## Sprint Goal
Build and implement the foundation for a code search system that accepts Git repositories, processes their content, and creates searchable indexes. This sprint addresses business requirements BR1, BR2 and functional requirements FR1.1, FR2.1, FR2.2, FR2.3. Also, implementation requirements (IR1, IR2, IR4) and non-functional requirements (NFR1, NFR3), are also addressed.


## Key Deliverables
1. Repository URL input interface with validation
2. Git repository fetching and processing service
3. Code indexing system with search capabilities
4. Basic architectural foundation for future sprints

## User Stories (Prioritized)

1. **Repository Input** (15 points) - *FR1.1, FR2.1, NFR2, NFR3*
   As a user, I want to specify a Git repository URL so that I can inspect its code.
   
   **Tasks:**
   - Create UI component for repository URL input (5pts) - *FR1.1, NFR2*
   - Implement URL validation with clear feedback (3pts) - *FR1.1, NFR3*
   - Create Git client for repository cloning (7pts) - *FR2.1, IR1*
   
   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - System accepts valid GitHub URLs and rejects invalid ones with clear messages - *FR1.1, NFR3*
   - Repository cloning shows progress indication - *FR2.1, NFR2*
   - User receives confirmation when repository is successfully loaded - *NFR2*
   
   **Related Requirements:** BR1 (Code Search Productivity), NFR1 (Performance)

2. **Code Processing** (20 points) - *FR2.1, FR2.2, FR1.4*
   As a user, I want the system to process repository code so that I can search it effectively.
   
   **Tasks:**
   - Implement file traversal and content extraction (8pts) - *FR2.1, FR2.2*
   - Add language detection and file filtering (4pts) - *FR1.4*
   - Create code chunking strategy for processing (8pts) - *FR2.2*
   
   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - System correctly identifies and processes different file types - *FR1.4*
   - Code files are properly chunked for indexing - *FR2.2*
   - File filtering works according to user preferences - *FR1.4*
   
   **Related Requirements:** BR2 (Code Understanding), NFR1 (Performance)

3. **Search Indexing** (15 points) - *FR2.2, FR2.3*
   As a user, I want my repository code to be indexed so that I can search it quickly.
   
   **Tasks:**
   - Implement code embedding generation (8pts) - *FR2.2, IR2*
   - Create vector database integration (7pts) - *FR2.3, IR2*
   
   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Code is properly indexed and stored - *FR2.2, FR2.3*
   - Search operations complete within 3 seconds - *NFR1*
   - Search results are relevant to queries - *BR2*
   
   **Related Requirements:** BR2 (Code Understanding), NFR1 (Performance), IR2 (Langchain4J Integration)

## Technical Implementation Notes
- We'll use Langchain4J for embedding generation - *IR2*
- Vector storage will be implemented with Qdrant - *IR3*
- All implementation will be in Scala - *IR1*
- Focus on layered architecture with clear separation of concerns - *IR4*
- Make use of design patterns presented in the lectures - *IR1*

## Success Metrics
- Repository loading completes in <30 seconds for repos up to 100MB
- Search operations complete in <3 seconds
- 90% of test cases for validation and processing pass
