## Completed Tasks

### User Functional Requirements Tests
- Implemented UserFunctionalRequirementsSuite covering repository URL input and code search
- Created comprehensive scenarios for repository processing and language query tests
- Added performance validation criteria for search operations

### System Functional Requirements Tests
- Developed SystemFunctionalRequirementsSuite for repository management and vector database tests
- Implemented tests for repository cloning and embedding generation
- Added LLM integration tests for code understanding validation

## Technical Details
- Used ScalaTest FeatureSpec with GivenWhenThen for behavior-driven tests
- Implemented performance validation for critical operations
- Added integration with Qdrant for vector database tests
- Comprehensive repository management tests with GitHub API

## Next Steps
- Complete non-functional requirements tests
- Enhance test coverage for edge cases
- Add business requirements validation tests
