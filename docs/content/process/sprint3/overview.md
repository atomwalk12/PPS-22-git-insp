Duration: 1 week (Start date: 2025-04-07, End date: 2025-04-13)

The following sections build on the [Requirements Specifications](../../static/requirement-specifications.md) document.

## Sprint Goal

1. **Natural Language Code Search** *(FR1.2, FR1.3, FR1.4, FR1.5, BR1, NFR2)*
   - Enable semantic search across indexed codebases
   - Support language/extension filtering capabilities
   - Display search results with proper code context

2. **Code Understanding Chat Interface** *(FR1.6, FR1.5, FR2.4, BR2, NFR2)*
   - Provide interactive chat interface for code questions
   - Retrieve and use relevant code context for queries
   - Generate context-aware responses with code references

3. **User Interface Implementation** *(NFR2, IR1, NFR3)*
   - Create intuitive frontend for search and chat functionality
   - Support Scala.js interface components
   - Ensure responsive and accessible design

4. **Technical Debt & Testing** *(IR4, NFR1, FR1.2)*
   - Implement ArchUnit tests for layered architecture
   - Create acceptance tests for repository loading
   - Develop search relevance and chat accuracy testing

## Sprint Retrospective

- **What went well?**
  - Many tasks carried over from the previous sprint have been completed
    - Acceptance tests involving all types of requirements were built. This includes tests for the requirements
      listed in the requirements document.
  - Much of the technical debt has been resolved
  - Implemented the search functionality with filtering capabilities
  - Added comprehensive test suites for validating functional, business, and non-functional requirements using BDD-style tests

- **What could be improved?**
  - Not all planned tasks were completed:
    - The Scala.js interface components (S3.3.2) implementation was only started but not completed
    - ArchUnit tests for layered architecture (S3.4.1) remain to be implemented
    - Chat accuracy evaluation (S3.4.4) wasn't completed
  - Frontend development in Scala.js requires more attention in the next sprint
  - Integration between the backend and frontend components needs further refinement

- **What did I learn?**
  - BDD-style testing with ScalaTest FeatureSpec provides a clear way to validate requirements
  - Modern build tools like Vite improve the frontend development experience by allowing to dynamically reload changes
  - Implementing comprehensive test suites early helps validate that requirements are being met correctly
  - Python prototyping allowed for quick validation of UI concepts before full Scala.js implementation
