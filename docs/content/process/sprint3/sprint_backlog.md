summary: "List of deliverables for Sprint 3 (April 7-13, 2025), focusing on natural language code search and chat interface implementation."
---


**Tasks from Sprint 2:**
- Acceptance tests for repository loading
- Taking code notes upon completion of requirements
- The need for ArchUnit to verify the layered architecture

**Sprint Goal:** Develop a fully functional search interface and code understanding chat assistant that leverages the indexed repository data to provide intelligent code insights and responses to natural language queries.

**Key Deliverables:**
1. Natural language code search interface with filtering capabilities
2. Code understanding chat interface with context-aware responses
3. Responsive UI implementation for both search and chat features
4. Testing infrastructure for search relevance and chat accuracy
