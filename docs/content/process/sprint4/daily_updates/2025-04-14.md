## Completed Tasks

### Sprint Planning
- Conducted sprint planning meeting
- Finalized the Sprint 4 backlog with prioritized tasks
- Assigned effort estimates to each task

### Performance Optimization
- Started analyzing repository lookup performance bottlenecks
- Identified key areas for optimization in the code loading process
- Created benchmark tests to measure current performance

## Technical Details
- Set up performance profiling tools to measure repository processing times
- Conducted initial analysis of embedding generation performance
- Identified potential caching strategies for frequently accessed repositories

## Next Steps
- Implement repository lookup speed optimizations
- Begin work on embedding caching mechanism
- Set up visualization framework for code embeddings
