## Completed Tasks

### Embedding Caching Implementation
- Designed caching mechanism for code embeddings
- Implemented initial version of cache using Redis
- Created cache invalidation strategy for repository updates

### Scala.js Frontend Development
- Continued work on Scala.js interface components started in Sprint 3
- Implemented responsive layout using Laminar library
- Created reusable UI components for search and chat interfaces

## Technical Details
- Cache implementation uses Redis for in-memory storage of embeddings
- Added TTL (time-to-live) settings for cached items
- Frontend components follow functional reactive programming principles
- Implemented state management using Laminar signals

## Next Steps
- Complete repository lookup speed optimizations
- Begin work on code embedding visualization
- Connect frontend components to backend services
