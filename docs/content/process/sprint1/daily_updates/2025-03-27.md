### 2.2. Requirement Types Explained

- **Business Requirements (BR):** Strategic goals that define the project's overall purpose. _Example:_ Improving developer productivity through code search tools.
- **Functional Requirements (FR):** Specific system behaviors and user interactions.
  - **User Requirements (FR1.x):** What users can do with the system (interactions and observable outcomes). _Example:_ Searching code by keywords.
  - **System Requirements (FR2.x):** Internal system operations. _Example:_ Cloning Git repositories.
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):** System quality attributes. _Example:_ Performance speed, user interface usability.
- **Implementation Requirements (IR):** Technical implementation constraints. _Example:_ Using Scala as the primary programming language.

## Next Steps

- Choose between the different diagram types to illustrate the design (i.e. class, object, component, package, sequence, state, activity, etc.)

- Read up on the design patterns that may be useful to use (lecture 1, 13, 14).
