## Completed Tasks

1. Project Initialization
   - Set up basic Scala 3.6.4 project structure
   - Configured SBT build file with essential settings
   - Added assembly plugin for JAR creation

2. Development Tools Integration
   - Implemented Scalafmt for code formatting
   - Added Wartremover for static code analysis
   - Configured Scalafix for additional linting
   - Integrated Trunk for code style checks

3. Testing Infrastructure
   - Added ScalaTest framework
   - Configured Scoverage for code coverage
   - Set up test isolation and memory settings

4. Git Workflow Enhancement
   - Implemented custom git hooks system
   - Added semantic release configuration
   - Set up conventional commits enforcement

5. Logging Setup
   - Added scala-logging and logback-classic dependencies
   - Configured basic logging infrastructure

## Challenges
- Resolving merge conflicts in semantic release configuration
- Coordinating multiple code quality tools without conflicts

## Next Steps
- Think about how the project architecture should look like
- Configure automated documentation generation for tests and comments
- Begin core feature development
