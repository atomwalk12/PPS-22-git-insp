## Workflow Design
Below is a diagram consisting in a series of steps to follow that would hopefully lead to the creation of a working application.

### Workflow Description

The workflow diagram outlines the complete development process for the Git Inspector project:

* **Main Workflow (Top)**: Sequential progression through key milestones from getting started to final reporting, including ecosystem review, planning, lecture notes review, setup, connecting concepts, website building, and findings documentation.

* **Planning/Conduction (Bottom Left)**: Focused on project management, code management, and plan expansion with supporting tools for CI/CD, linting, testing, and Git repository management.

* **Experimentation (Bottom Right)**: Implementation cycle of developing features, writing unit tests, and creating Docker environments with validation checkpoints throughout.

The workflow integrates planning and experimentation phases with the main development flow, ensuring comprehensive coverage of all project aspects.

## Architecture Diagram

*   **Presentation Layer (Frontend):**
    *   Handles user interaction (both Scala and Python web interfaces).
    *   Sends requests to the Application Layer and displays responses.
    *   Focuses on UI/UX and user-facing logic.
    *   *Modules:* `ScalaWebUI`, `PythonWebUI`.
*   **Application Layer (API/Service Layer):**
    *   Exposes the application's functionalities as APIs.
    *   Receives requests from the Presentation Layer.
    *   Orchestrates business logic by interacting with the Domain Layer.
    *   Does not contain business logic itself, but rather coordinates it.
    *   *Modules:*  `GitInspectorAPI`.
*   **Domain Layer (Business Logic Layer):**
    *   Contains the core business logic of Git Inspector.
    *   Implements functionalities like fetching, indexing, searching, and chatting.
    *   Independent of presentation and data access concerns.
    *   *Modules:* `IndexingService`, `SearchService`, `ChatService`, `GitFetcherService`.
*   **Infrastructure Layer (Data Access/External Services):**
    *   Handles interactions with external systems and data storage.
    *   Includes components for:
        *   Ollama integration (LLM interaction).
        *   Qdrant integration (Vector database).
        *   URL fetching.
        *   Configuration management.
        *   Logging.
    *   *Modules:* `LangchainClient`, `QdrantClientWrapper`, `URLFetcher`, `ConfigManager`, `Logger`.
