summary: "Refining the requirements to create the requirements specification document. Also, defining the domain model which will surely be modified in the following days."

## Domain Model

![Domain Model](../../../../static/figures/PPS-domain-model-class-diagram.svg)

## Refining Requirements Specifications
The following requirements were refined by adding implementation details to the requirements [defined yesterday](2025-03-27.md#requirements-table).

## Traceability Matrix

To trace the requirements to the design elements, I will use a traceability matrix. This matrix will be 
populated by running unit tests, which will populate a table with the following format:


<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<table style="display: table;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Requirement</th>
      <th>Design element</th>
      <th>Implementation Evidence</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>FR1.1</td>
      <td>inspectGitRepository</td>
      <td>inspectGitRepository.scala</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FR1.2</td>
      <td>searchCode</td>
      <td>searchCode.scala</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FR2.1</td>
      <td>buildVectorDatabase</td>
      <td>buildVectorDatabase.scala</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>FR2.2</td>
      <td>optimizeSearch</td>
      <td>optimizeSearch.scala</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>


## Next Steps

- Revise the architecture diagram [defined on Wednesday](2025-03-26.md#architecture-diagram).

- It may be useful to think create alternative representations to the class diagram defined [above](#domain-model). For instance sequence, object, component, package or activity diagrams may be useful.

- Potentially think about design patterns that may be feasible to use.
