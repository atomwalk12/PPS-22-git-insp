## Domain Model

## Refining Requirements Specifications
The following requirements were refined by adding implementation details to the requirements [defined yesterday](2025-03-27.md#requirements-table).

## Next Steps

- Revise the architecture diagram [defined on Wednesday](2025-03-26.md#architecture-diagram).

- It may be useful to think create alternative representations to the class diagram defined [above](#domain-model). For instance sequence, object, component, package or activity diagrams may be useful.

- Potentially think about design patterns that may be feasible to use.
