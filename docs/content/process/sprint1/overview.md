Duration: 1 week (Start date: 2025-03-24, End date: 2025-03-30)

## Sprint Goal

Sprint 1 focused on setting up the project infrastructure and development environment. This includes:

1. Setting up the basic Scala project structure
2. Implementing essential development tools and configurations
3. Establishing code quality standards and automated checks
4. Creating a reliable CI/CD pipeline

Deliverables:

- Basic project structure with Scala 3.6.4
- Automated code formatting and linting setup
- Git hooks for code quality checks
- Test infrastructure with ScalaTest
- Code coverage reporting with Scoverage
- Semantic release configuration
- Logging infrastructure
