## Sprint 1 Backlog

### User Stories
1. **Development Setup**
   - As a developer, I want a properly configured Scala project so I can efficiently develop the application
   - As a developer, I want linting and formatting tools configured so code quality remains consistent

2. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - As a developer, I want GitHub Actions configured for CI/CD so code is automatically built and tested
   - As a developer, I want documentation automatically generated and published so it stays current

3. **Basic Repository Loading**
   - As a user, I want to load a local Git repository so I can inspect its contents
   - As a user, I want to see basic repository information to confirm it loaded correctly
