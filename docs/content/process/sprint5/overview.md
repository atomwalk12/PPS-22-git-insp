The following sections build on the [Requirements Specifications](../../static/requirement-specifications.md) document.

## Sprint Goal

1. **Testing and Quality Assurance** *(IR1, NFR1, NFR2)*
   - Since the code is stable, write down the ArchUnit tests
   - Define quality metrics using PCA and pairwise analysis

2. **Visualization and Analysis** *(IR5, FR1.2, BR2, NFR4)*
   - Visualize code embeddings for quality analysis
   - Generate insights for documentation through scatter plots and pair-wise heatmaps

3. **Documentation and Reporting** *(NFR2, IR4)*
   - Create user documentation generated from code comments
   - Complete project report

4. **Project Housekeeping** *(IR1, NFR2)*
   - Perform code refactoring and cleanup
   - Prepare for project release
   - Finalize website based on the Nerfies template
